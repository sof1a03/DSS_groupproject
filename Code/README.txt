# Repository Overview

This section of the repository is organized into three main components:

## App
Contains the application layer, including scripts for running the dashboard, APIs, and visualization interfaces.  
_Last update: repository hygiene and structure cleanup._

## ETL
Includes Extract–Transform–Load (ETL) scripts for processing and integrating raw datasets.  
The most recent update (`03_REGIONAL_load.py`) handles regional-level data loading and transformation.

## Features
Stores feature engineering notebooks and scripts created in Google Colab.  
Used for generating derived indicators and preparing datasets for analysis and model training.

### Purpose
These folders collectively form the project pipeline — from data ingestion (ETL) to feature creation and final application deployment (App).
